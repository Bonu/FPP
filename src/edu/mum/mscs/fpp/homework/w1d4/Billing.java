/**
 * 
 * 3. Create a class named Billing that includes three overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store.
	•	When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one
	photo book ordered. Add 8% tax, and return the total due.
	•	When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a
	photo book and the quantity ordered. Multiply the two values, add 8% tax, and
	return the total due.
	•	When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo
	book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value(% of deduction). Multiply the quantity and price, 
	reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8% tax and return the total due.
	
	Write a main() method that tests all three overloaded methods.
