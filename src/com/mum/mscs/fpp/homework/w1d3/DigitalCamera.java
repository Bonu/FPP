 * 
 * 2.a	Create a class for EBayâ€™s Camera Store, which is having a digital camera sale. 
 * The class is named as DigitalCamera, and it contains data fields for a brand, the 
 * number of megapixels in the resolution, and price. Include a constructor that takes 
 * arguments for the brand and megapixels. If the megapixel parameter is greater than 10, 
 * the constructor sets it to 10. The sale price is set based on the resolution; any 
 * camera with 6 megapixels or fewer is $99, and all other cameras are $129. Also include 
 * a method that displays DigitalCamera details. 
 * 
 * This class is tested in TestDigitalCamera.java
